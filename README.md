## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned

Diving into my first project with Sass was like jumping into the deep end. I thought it'd be easy-peasy at first, but boy, was I wrong. The biggest pain was figuring out how to get those partial imports in the right order. I was glued to the computer for hours, trying all sorts of stuff, and it turned out the problem was just the order of the imports, go figure! But hey, even with those bumps in the road, I liked using Sass. It helps make the code cleaner and way easier to handle. Still, I've got a ways to go. I know I haven't tapped into everything Sass can do.


### Continued development

i dont plan to revisit this project, i want to move on and practice more scss.
